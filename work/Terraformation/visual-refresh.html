                <p class="L">"It feels a little <i>sterile</i>."</p>
                <p class="M">â€”our internal users, noting the web and
                    mobile apps' starkness and lack of color. The executive team was also
                    pitching to investors soon, so the product team was concerned; if our software products
                    felt barebones or like they lacked personality, we might have
                    less of a chance of securing funding.
                </p>
                <p class="L">Our apps are using <i>blue</i> as our primary color, but the company's brand color
                    is <i>green</i>.</p>
                <p class="M">The blue that we were using in our apps was a legacy from our previous
                    head of design, who had been advocating for changing the company brand color to blue. Since that
                    didn't end up happening, it left our product branding unaligned.

                <p class="M">I led the design team in initial branding exercises and brainstorming, then
                    took the reins, continuing to iterate and refine. Once the visual approach
                    was finalized, I worked with Chudo, our design systems expert, to create and roll out Kaloko, v2 of
                    our design system.

                            towards. I wanted everyone to have a voice in the process, so I started off by inviting my
                            design team members, as well as designers in marcomms and my design manager, to complete
                            some branding exercises.<br><br>
                            I then compiled all of the results for a team discussion. We
                            highlighted areas of overlap, and discussed where we had differing opinions. To wrap up the
                            exercise, we voted on the top adjectives, and after further discussion, defined four
                            adjectives to characterize our rebrand moving forward.</p>

                            of the designers do "mild" and "wild" explorations, mild being close to what we have now,
                            and wild being more blue sky. See a few of my explorations below:

                            adjectives we chose at the start, I conducted a card sorting test. It was gratifying to see
                            that most of the adjectives that users chose matched up well with the
                            direction we were aiming for.<br><br>
                            For usability, I also received lots
                            of helpful feedback; for example, though people found the gradient on the bottom action bar
                            visually appealing, they didn't like the extra space that it took, or the fact that it
                            obstructed them from seeing or interacting with elements below it.

                            However, designers and devs pointed out concerns that this would take up a lot of

                            Some of our current color values felt too bright
                            or neon, and I wanted to adjust those shades as part of the visual refresh. I started by
                            exploring options for different palettes using <a
                                href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF"
                                target="_blank">Paletton</a>, which lets you create
                            palettes that are evenly spaced on a color wheel. I experimented with both our green-500 and
                            green-600 as the baseline color, and decided that green-500 worked better.<br><br>
                            After settling on a base palette, I generated color scales using <a
                                href="https://leonardocolor.io/theme.html#" target="_blank">Leonardo</a>. I compared
                            results of different color space interpolations, testing how they would look on our
                            components, and chose the one that looked most uniform across different colors while still
                            remaining reasonably vibrant.

                        <p class="M">Since blue was no longer our primary color, we needed to define how our brand green
                            would work as our primary color, and how that would affect our other semantic colors. After
                            discussion, we decided to use our lighter green for
                            success messaging, so our brand color could be distinct. We debated using blue for
                            default messaging (eg. a regular toast), but decided to reserve it for selected and focus
                            states and use grey instead.<br><br>
                            Withe all of these changes, Chudo
                            wanted to take the chance to also redo the design tokens for our color system. The tokens
                            that we had been using were mostly component-based instead of semantic, which resulted in a
                            lot of redundancy. We worked closely together to define new semantic tokens and translate
                            them to our existing components, as well as roll the new tokens out into code
                            with engineers.

                <p class="L">Visual design has a <i>lot</i> of influence on feel.</p>
                <p class="M">It's easy for some to discount the importance of visual design, but this project reminded
                    me just how impactful it is. I was struck during early explorations seeing how even
                    minute changes could create such a difference in look and feel. Every color and style carries its
                    own connotations, and it's up to designers to purposefully curate them.
                </p>
                <p class="L">Leadership <i>requires putting pressure</i> on anyone who's are lagging.</p>
                <p class="M">While leading the initial team exercises, I ran into some issues with team members not
                    meeting deadlines. Since I wanted everyone to be involved, I pushed back the deadline for certain
                    exercises, but this caused me to not be able to meet one of my own deadlines later. In hindsight, I
                    shouldn't have felt like I was repsonsible for including everyone; if they didn't meet a deadline
                    that was set, then it was fair for them to miss their chance to contribute.
