                <p class="M">I joined NOVID just months after it was first established, as the third designer on the
                    team.
                    At the time, most of the team's existing designs were quick and scrappy, fitting for an early stage
                    startup. However, what this resulted in was inconsistency in our design language, and as a
                    consequence, hard-coded styles and a lack of structure for our engineers. Additionally, the team
                    wanted to address accessibility concerns and explore features like dark mode.

                <p class="L">A new <i>cross-platform</i> design system with <i>accessibility</i> in mind.</P>
                <p class="M">We established brand colors, a responsive type system, spacing and layout, an updated icon
                    set, and design components for buttons, inputs, and modals. These were published as Figma components
                    and libraries, including specs and redlines for our engineers, who translated them into components
                    in storybook. We also met WCAG AA standards on our site and app and added a dark mode.

                            workmark that would allow for sub-brands, so I explored ways to update our wordmark to look
                            cleaner and more consistent. With the CEO's ok, I also took the chance to explore alternate
                            logomark options. In the end, the design team and the CEO agreed that it would be best to
                            avoid drastic changes and instead subtly modify the existing logo.</p>

                            inputs for both light and dark mode. This was unexpectedly difficult, since I had to follow
                            the color system and also keep accessibility guidelines in mind. During this process, I
                            learned some interesting details about accessibility standards (for example, disabled states
                            don't need to meet as high of a contrast standard). After defining the colors, I also
                            created Figma components for each element.

                <p class="M">This was my first foray into design systems and looking back, though it was a bit clumsy,
                    it definitely gave me a good framework to reference for future design systems work.
                    It's funny how a lot of the problems we tried to solve (for example, using master components or not,
                    creating variations of components, and prototyping interactiveness and microinteractions) are now
                    addressed by new Figma features like variants and interactive components. That being said, I feel
                    like I learned a lot by having to make my own hackneyed solutions to create structure before those
                    features were available.
                </p>
                <p class="L">It's important to <i>keep engineers in the loop</i>.</p>
                <p class="M">I also learned a lot through working directly with engineers and QAing
                    through storybook. Overall, it was very gratifying seeing my work come to life in code and then roll
                    out through both the website and the app.</p>
