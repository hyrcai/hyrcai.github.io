                <p class="L">Our mobile app architecture <i>doesn't account for</i> new features.</p>
                <p class="M">When the mobile app was created, it was with only one feature in mind: saving seed
                    collection data. Since we were working on adding a new feature, we needed to rethink
                    our app architecture so that it would account for multiple flows.
                </p>
                <p class="L">We need to instruct users to <i>set up plots</i> for plant monitoring in the field.</p>
                <p class="M">Due to the way our plant monitoring model worked, we needed to create a flow
                    instructing users to create physical plot boundaries at specific, programmatically generated
                    locations in their planting sites. This was the first mapping feature in our platform, so it
                    introduced a lot of new interactions and UI patterns.

                <p class="M">I explored various UI patterns for multiple features, including tabs, mini apps, and a new
                    menu, before settling on the best change for our architecture.

                </P>
                <p class="M">I worked with a project manager and an engineer to define requirements and scope for map
                    features, then designed a framework and components for them. I experimented with
                    different patterns for overlaid views before creating copywriting,
                    illustrations, UX, and UI for the plot setup flow.

                            friendly. Though people responded well to the color coding, black and white read better in
                            the field, where bright sunlight can make it hard to differentiate colors. We also
                            decided to keep uploads as flow-specific; it made more sense to wait to develope a global
                            upload when or if we added more features.

                            text, I ended up doing all of the copywriting myself.

                            I added some updates to some functionality; for example, the code library that Josh was
                            using required the use of tappable "markers" for each clickable shape, so I created new
                            assets for them.</p>

                <p class="M">I explored many different directions for app architecture, but the
                    design that was settled on after discussion was one that was very simple. Though I tend to favor
                    "aesthetic" designs that feel more visually appealing, simpler designs can often be better options for UX
                    due to their clarity.
                </p>
                <p class="L">Users who <i>aren't tech savvy</i> won't understand UI patterns that we take for common
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p class="M">Many of Terraformation's users are forestry field workers who aren't very tech savvy, which
                    is why I ended up scrapping the explorations for popover messaging that involved cards. Though the
                    goal was to have users swipe the card up and down to hide and show the instructions as they wished,
                    we wouldn't have known if they would have understood that UI pattern without user testing, which we
                    unfortunately didn't have the resources for at the time.
